# Ed's Keymaps

Keymaps for the keyboards I use (or plan to use in the near future).

## Custom QMK Fork

My keymaps require to be compiled with [my custom QMK fork](https://github.com/edwardkopp/qmk_firmware); my keymaps are incompatible with the main fork.

## Original README

The instructions from the original README file have been moved to `INSTRUCTIONS.md` .
