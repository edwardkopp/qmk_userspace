# Ed's Keymaps

Keymaps for the keyboards I use (or plan to use in the near future).

## Custom QMK Fork

My keymaps are incompatible with the main QMK firmware branch, and must be compiled with [my custom QMK fork](https://github.com/edwardkopp/qmk_firmware).

## Mac Compatibility

I don't have dedicated layers for Mac as I just swap Command and Control in System Settings.
