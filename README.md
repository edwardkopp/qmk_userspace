# Ed's Keymaps

Keymaps for the keyboards I use (or plan to use in the near future).

## Custom QMK Fork

My keymaps are incompatible with the main QMK firmware branch, and must be compiled with [my custom QMK fork](https://github.com/edwardkopp/qmk_firmware).

## Original README

The original README can be found [here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_userspace).
